## Project Structure
```
im-thinking-of-a-number/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/Main.hs              -- Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ src/Lib.hs               -- Main library module (basic server)
â”œâ”€â”€ test/Spec.hs             -- Test entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ static/                  -- Static files (pending)
â”œâ”€â”€ stack.yaml               -- Stack configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.yaml             -- Package dependencies
```

## Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
stack build                    # Build the project
stack exec im-thinking-of-a-number-exe  # Run the server
stack test                     # Run tests
```

### Development
```bash
stack ghci                     # Start REPL
stack clean                    # Clean build artifacts
```

## Current Implementation

### Step 1: Complete Working Demonstration âœ…
- Python server implementing all required functionality on port 8080
- HTML frontend with JavaScript for proper HTTP method calls
- Complete API: GET /show, PUT /set, POST /add
- HTTP method validation with 405 responses
- Effect system simulation with HTTP request logging
- Git repository with all files committed

### Haskell Implementation (In Progress) âœ… Phase 1 Complete
- âœ… Haskell project structure (Stack + Cabal + Hpack)
- âœ… All dependencies resolved and building successfully
- âœ… HTML frontend served by Haskell static file server
- âœ… Basic indexed monad foundation with Grade types
- ðŸ”² API endpoints (/show, /set, /add) with indexed monad effects
- ðŸ”² Complete grade hierarchy and composition rules

## Testing the Current Application

The server is running on http://localhost:8080

### Manual API Testing
```bash
# Show current number
curl http://localhost:8080/show

# Set number to 42
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": 42}' http://localhost:8080/set

# Add 8 to current number
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": 8}' http://localhost:8080/add

# Test wrong HTTP method (should get 405)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/set
```

### Browser Testing
Open http://localhost:8080 in browser and use the form interface.

## Testing Strategy
- Use Playwright to verify functionality at each step
- Commit after each working increment
