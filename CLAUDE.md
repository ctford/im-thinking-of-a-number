## Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
stack build                    # Build the project
stack exec im-thinking-of-a-number-exe  # Run the server
stack test                     # Run tests
```

### Development
```bash
stack ghci                     # Start REPL
stack clean                    # Clean build artifacts
```

## Current Implementation

### Step 1: Complete Working Demonstration ✅
- Python server implementing all required functionality on port 8080
- HTML frontend with JavaScript for proper HTTP method calls
- Complete API: GET /show, PUT /set, POST /add
- HTTP method validation with 405 responses
- Effect system simulation with HTTP request logging
- Git repository with all files committed

### Haskell Implementation (In Progress) ✅ Phase 1 Complete
- ✅ Haskell project structure (Stack + Cabal + Hpack)
- ✅ All dependencies resolved and building successfully
- ✅ HTML frontend served by Haskell static file server
- ✅ Basic indexed monad foundation with Grade types
- 🔲 API endpoints (/show, /set, /add) with indexed monad effects
- 🔲 Complete grade hierarchy and composition rules

## Testing the Current Application

The server is running on http://localhost:8080

### Manual API Testing
```bash
# Show current number
curl http://localhost:8080/show

# Set number to 42
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": 42}' http://localhost:8080/set

# Add 8 to current number
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": 8}' http://localhost:8080/add

# Test wrong HTTP method (should get 405)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/set
```

### Browser Testing
Open http://localhost:8080 in browser and use the form interface.

## Testing Strategy
- Use Playwright to verify functionality at each step
- Commit after each working increment
