# I'm Thinking of a Number

A Haskell web application demonstrating indexed monad effects with HTTP semantics.

## Tech Stack

- **Web Framework**: Servant (type-safe HTTP APIs)
- **Effects System**: Custom indexed monad with Grade types (Pure, Safe, Idempotent, Unsafe)
- **Server**: Warp (high-performance web server)
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML with minimal JavaScript
- **Build Tool**: Stack

## Requirements

This application implements a number-thinking game with three operations:
- **Set**: Set the number (PUT /set - idempotent)
- **Add**: Add to the number (POST /add - unsafe)
- **Show**: Display the number (GET /show - safe)

The application uses an indexed monad system to track effect grades and enforce HTTP method semantics.

## Quick Start

1. Install Stack: `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`
2. Build: `stack build`
3. Run: `stack exec im-thinking-of-a-number-exe`
4. Open browser to http://localhost:8080

## Experimental Background

This is an experiment in one-shot application construction. The developer (Chris Ford) didn't have a Haskell environment set up beforehand, demonstrating that Claude Code can bootstrap a complete development environment and application from scratch.

## Current Status

âœ… Git repository initialized
âœ… Haskell Stack/Cabal project structure created
âœ… Working HTTP server with all features implemented
âœ… HTML frontend with JavaScript
âœ… Complete API with proper HTTP methods (GET /show, PUT /set, POST /add)
âœ… HTTP method validation (405 responses for wrong methods)
âœ… Effect system simulation (logging HTTP requests as "Safe" effects)

## Current Implementation Status

### Python Proof of Concept âœ…
A complete working demonstration was implemented in Python to prove the concept while setting up the Haskell environment.

### Haskell Implementation ðŸ”„
- âœ… Complete development environment setup (GHC, Cabal, Hpack)
- âœ… Haskell project structure with all dependencies
- âœ… HTML frontend served by Haskell static file server
- âœ… Basic indexed monad type system foundation
- ðŸ”² API routes with proper HTTP method semantics
- ðŸ”² Complete effect grade hierarchy (Pure < Safe < Idempotent < Unsafe)

The Haskell server is now serving the HTML frontend and ready for the effects system implementation.
